# etch-a-sketch

Etch a sketch project for The Odin Project!

Couple of issues with the code. For one, some box numbers result in the boxes wrapping too early, leaving a gap on the side. From what I can tell, this is an issue when the site is being rendered, as the boxes have to align to pixels. A workaround would be to define rows or columns in the play area, and then populate those with the correct number of boxes. Make the container as big as those rows/columns, and all of the boxes would fit nicely where they should. As it stands however, I am leaving this bug. 

Two, it slow as heck! Oh well!
